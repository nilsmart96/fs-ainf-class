        "A graph is a flexible unordered data structure representing entities and their relations in an informative and compact manner.\n",
        "\n",
        "The two main components of graphs are:\n",
        "- __Nodes__ (also called vertices, or vertex in singular) are the main objects or entities, for which the connections are to be represented\n",
        "- __Connections__ (also called edges) are representing the presence or absence of certain pre-defined relations amongst the nodes.\n",

        "\n",
        "Graphs are very general and flexible, and are utilized nearly ubiquitously in many domains. They are considered unordered, since (without further restrictions) do not represent any global ordering, so they can be __\"traversed\"__, in multiple ways, following along their connection structure \"step by step\", where in a given step we start from a node, and \"travel along\" a given edge to arrive at another vertex.\n",
        "\n",
        "Introducing additional restrictions on graphs can lead to other previously discussed datastructures, like __trees__, which are basically __special cases of graphs__ in general.\n",
        "\n",
        "There is also considerable amount of flexibility about __what constitutes a vertex__, and __what number and type of connections are allowed__.\n",

        "Regarding the edges in the graph, we can define __directed__ or __undirected__ graphs, whereby in the first case, we also store the __\"origin\"__ and __\"destination\"__ information of an edge, but in the second case, we leave this property undefined, signifying only the presence of a mutual connection.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Maximum degree\n",
        "\n",
        "Also noteworthy attribute of a graph is the number of allowed number of connections per node, also called __degree__.\n",
        "\n",
        "In a general graph there are no restrictions on how many nodes can connect to each-other, hence the maximum number of connections is $n-1$ in case of $n$ nodes, forming a [complete graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complete_graph).\n",
